class Question < ApplicationRecord
    #This file was generated with: rails g model question
    #A model Question has been created, which is a respresentation of an instance of a Question
    #Models are always singular, at it is convention to capitalize the name

    #Also, a corresponding migration file was generated when generating the model
    #To add properties to an instance of Question you can add it to the terminal or
    #add it to the migration file: rails g model question title:string body:text
    #To run the migration, do: rails db:migrate
    #Never make changes to the migration file after migrating it
    #Instead, run: rails db:rollback
    #OR create a new migration to make changes to the existing table

    #remove_column -> method available through ActiveRecord
    #:questions -> the table we're adding to
    #:like_count -> the column we're removing
    #:integer -> the type of the column -> this is not needed when removing the column

    #Alternatively, you could do rails db:rollback
    #If you want to rollback to a specific migration, you can do:
    #rails db:rollback STEP=2 (which would rollback 2 migrations, for example)

    #You can find more information about migrations here: http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html

    #--------------------Naming Conventions----------------------------->
    # A model is always singular and database tables are always plural

    #==============CALLBACKS================>
    #Example of a cycle in ActiveRecord
    # Initialize -> Validate -> Save -> Commit to database
    after_initialize :set_defaults
    #this callback is executed after you have q = Question.create(....setting attributes...)
    #if you give a value for the specific attribute, it will be set to that value, otherwise
    #this method will set the value to the default value

    before_save :capitalize_title
    #q = Question.create(title:"hello", body:"World", view_count:2)
    #before_save will turn title into "Hello" before saving into the database

    has_many :answers, dependent: :destroy
    # :destroy -> when you delete a question, the answers that belong to this question will also
    # be deleted automatically by rails
    # :nullify -> will set question_id to null for the records that are related to the question
    belongs_to :user

    has_and_belongs_to_many(
        :likes, #this is the name/alias we want to give it
        class_name: 'User', #this is the name of the model we are associating with
        join_table: 'likes', #this is the name of the join table
        association_foreign_key: 'user_id', #this is the name of the key that will act as the foreign key
        foreign_key: 'question_id' #this is the name of the key that will be used as the foreign key in the join
            #table of this table
    )

    #--------------------VALIDATIONS-------------------->
    # Create validations by using the 'validates' method
    # The arguments are (in order):
    # - A column name as a symbol 
    # - Named arguments, corresponding to the validation rules
    
    validates :title, presence: { message: "must be provided"} , uniqueness: {scope: :body}, length: { minimum: 2, maximum: 200 }
    #passing a default message
    #alternative for passing a message would be to use .errors.full_messages in console
    #unique to the scope of body means title doesn't need to be unique 
    #on its own, but does have to be unique in combination to the body
    
    validates :body, presence: true

    validates :view_count, numericality: { greater_or_equal_to: 0 }

    #=============CUSTOM VALIDATION===========>
    # Custom Validation
    # Be careful, the method for custom validations is
    # singular and its almost exactly same the method
    # for regular validations.
    #we use the "validate" instead of "validates" for custom validations
    validate :no_monkey

    #============SCOPES===========>
    # Create a scope with a class method
    # https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#scopes
    
    scope :recent_ten, lambda { order(created_at: :DESC).limit(10) }

    #below same as above:
    # def self.recent_ten
    #     order(created_at: :DESC).limit(10)
    # end

    # Scopes are such a commonly used feature that there's a way to 
    # create them quicker. It takes a name and a lambda as a callback
    scope :wildcard_search, ->(search_query) { where("title ILIKE '%#{search_query}%' or body ILIKE '%#{search_query}%' ")}

    # def self.wildcard_search(search_query)
    #     where("title ILIKE ? OR body ILIKE ?","%#{search_query}%","%#{search_query}%")
    # end

    # select * from questions where title ilike %??% and body ilike %???%;

    private

    def no_monkey
        if body&.downcase&.include?("monkey")
            # &. is the safe navigation operator. It's used like . operator
            # to call methods of the object
            # If the body doesn't exist,
            # this will return nil instead of getting an error
            self.errors.add(:body, "Must have no monkey")
            # To make a record invalid. You must add a 
            # validation error using the 'errors' 'add' method
            # It's arguments (in order):
            # - A symbol for the invalid column
            # - An error message as a string
        end
    end

    def set_defaults
        #self.view_count = 0 if self.view_count.nil?
        self.view_count ||= 0
    end

    def capitalize_title
        self.title.capitalize!
    end

#---------------------------- A C T I V E    R E C O R D -------------------------->
    # Fetch All Questions
    # questions = Question.all ðŸ‘ˆ this will give us back the list of questions as an object
    # the object behaves like an array so you can call methods on it like (.each) and you
    # can also chain it with other methods to do other types of operations and queries

    # Creating a new question
    # To create a new question object in memory do:
    # q = Question.new
    # you can also pass in a hash to the new method as in:
    # q = Question.new({ title: 'To be or not to be', body: 'is that a question?', view_count: 0 })
    # or for short:
    # q = Question.new title: 'To be or not to be }, body: 'is that a question?', view_count: 0 

    # to save the above question into questions table:
    # q.save ðŸ‘ˆ this will save that above question into the questions table (persist it)

    # Creating a record right away
    # you can create a record right away in the database using (.create) method as in:
    # Question.create({ title: 'My Question Title', body: 'My question body', view_count: 1 })

    # Fetching Records
    # .first
    # Question.first ðŸ‘ˆ fetches the first record ordered by the id in an ascending order
    # The sql equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" ORDER BY "questions"."id" ASC LIMIT 1;

    # .last
    # Question.last ðŸ‘ˆ fetches the last record ordered by the id in an ascending order 
    # The sql equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" ORDER BY "qeustions"."id" DESC LIMIT 1;

    # .find
    # Question.find(1) ðŸ‘ˆ finding records by their primary key which is likely id

    # .find_by_x ðŸ‘ˆ x is the column name
    # Question.find_by_title('My Last Question') ðŸ‘ˆ this finds a question with title 
    # exactly "My Last Question"

    # .where
    # Question.where({ title: 'My Last Question', body: 'The body of the question' })

    # WILDCARD SEARCHING 
    # You can perform  wildcard searching with ActiveRecord using LIKE within "where" method
    # Question.where(['title LIKE ?', '%Last%'])
    # if you are using Postgres client, you can use ILIKE for case-insensitive searching:
    # Question.where(['title ILIKE ?', '%Last%'])
    # Note that in above queries we used a syntax that used '?' to insert variable into a SQL query.
    # this is important to avoid SQL injection if the variable component is actually a user input such
    # as search term.

     # .limit
    # Question.limit(10) ðŸ‘ˆ this will give us back 10 first questions that are returned from the query

    # .order
    # Question.order(:created_at) ðŸ‘ˆ this will order the fetched records by created_at. by default is ASC and 
    # if you want them in descending order do:
    # Question.order(created_at: :DESC)


    # Chaining
    # You can chain the wher, limit, order, offset, and many others to compose
    # more sophisticated queries for example:
    # Question.where(['view_count > ?', 10]).where(['title ILIKE ?', 'a']).order(id: :DESC).limit(10).offset(10)
    # Note: offset will skip first 10 records from the above query
    # SQL equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" WHERE (view_count > 10) AND (title ILIKE 'a') ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10
    # another example:
    # Question.where(['view_count < ?', 10]).where(['body ILIKE ?', '%question%']).order(id: :DESC).limit(1).offset(1)

    # UPDATE RECORDS
    # once you've selected one or more records, you have ability to update them
    # Many setting attributes:
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.title = "Some new title"
    # q.save
    # q.view_count += 1
    # q.save

    # using .update_attributes or .update
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.update({ title: 'Updated Title', body: 'Updated body' }) or
    # q.update_attribute(:title, 'Updated Title') or
    # q.update_attributes(title: 'Updated Title', body: 'Updated body')

    # DELETING RECORDS
    # using .destroy
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.destroy

    # using .delete
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.delete

    # using .delete skips executing callback methods after_destroy and before_destroy 
    # and also skips deleting or nullifying associated records in the :dependant option
    # with associtations. Generally, avoid using ".delete" in favor of ".destroy". there are
    # only few cases when you want to use ".delete"

    # Aggregate functions
    # .count
    # Question.count ðŸ‘ˆ counts the number of records in questions model
    # SQL equivalent:
    # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "questions";

    # .groud
    # Question.select('avg(view_count)) as count').group('title')

    # CALLING RAW QUERIES
    # connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
    # result = connection.execute('SELECT * FROM questions WHERE id=1;')
    # result.first ðŸ‘ˆ because the result is an array of hashes
