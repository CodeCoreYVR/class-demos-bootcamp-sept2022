 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

After adding Bootstrap to Gemfile and uncommenting gem "sassc-rails",
rename this file from application.css to application.scss
Then import Bootstrap as below:
*/

@import "bootstrap";
@import "selectize";
@import "selectize.bootstrap3";

/*
Remember, every time you make a change to this file, or any other aseets in the asset directory, you will have
to run: rails assets:precompile
before you will see changes in the browser
This will allow you to load everything at once, and it won't need to reload each assets after every http request
