 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the

After adding Bootstrap to Gemfile and uncommenting gem "sassc-rails",

Remember, every time you make a change to this file, or any other aseets in the asset directory, you will have
to run: rails assets:precompile
before you will see changes in the browser
This will allow you to load everything at once, and it won't need to reload each assets after every http request
