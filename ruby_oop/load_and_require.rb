# When using Pry you can load a file by doing:
# `load './cookie.rb'` or `require './cookie.rb'`
# require will not load the file if it has been `required` or loaded already.
# this is useful when you have a big project so if the file is loaded once no
# need to reload it again.
# `load` is useful when you developing and making lots of changes to the file
# then it will force loading the file even if it's been previously loaded.

# load './rectangle.rb'
#Note: this will load the Rectangle class and print to the console
#but if you declared an instance of the class, like "r", it won't be available
#so create your own instance to test out the methods
